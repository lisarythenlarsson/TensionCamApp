“Camera applications”

Camera requirements will be included in the manifest. The unit requires a camera.
Both permission to use the hardware and permission to use the camera features will
be requested.

(In case of extension the manifest should include the location permission)


The built-in camera application will not be used. A customized camera application
will be built.

We choose not to detect camera hardware since it is already required in the
manifest

We choose not to investigate if the device has more than one camera, since the
Camera.open()-command accesses the primary camera, which is desired.


We have choosen to work with API-level 16 (4.1.2) as a minimim. We motivate that
choice with a deal we have made with our project providor, agreeing on the
Sony Xperia Z to be used as the running device. It runs 4.1.2 (or newer) and is
waterproof and shockproof with a big screen.
