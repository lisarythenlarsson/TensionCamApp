“Camera applications”

Camera requirements will be included in the manifest. The unit requires a camera.
Both permission to use the hardware and permission to use the camera features will
be requested.

(In case of extension the manifest should include the location permission)


The built-in camera application will not be used. A customized camera application
will be built.


We choose not to investigate if the device has more than one camera, since the
Camera.open()-command accesses the primary camera, which is desired.
